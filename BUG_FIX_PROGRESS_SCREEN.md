#  Bug Fix: Progress Screen Hardcoded Data

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Progress screen showed hardcoded/fake data instead of real user progress.

**Hardcoded Values**:
- Overall Progress: 65%
- Courses: 5
- Completed: 12
- Quizzes: 8
- Notes: 24
- Course Progress: Fake course names with random percentages
- Weekly Activity: Random bar chart values

---

##  Fix Applied

**File**: `lib/features/progress/screens/progress_screen.dart`

### **Converted to StatefulWidget with Real Data**

**Changes**:
1.  Converted from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
2.  Added database queries for all statistics
3.  Calculated real course progress
4.  Generated weekly activity from actual data
5.  Added loading state
6.  Added pull-to-refresh functionality

---

##  Real Data Sources

### **1. Overall Progress** 
**Calculation**: Average progress across all enrolled courses

```dart
_overallProgress = totalProgress / _courseProgress.length;
```

**Formula**:
- For each enrolled course: `completed_lessons / total_lessons`
- Overall: Average of all course progress percentages

---

### **2. Statistics Cards** 

| Stat | Database Query | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Courses** | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = ?` | Total enrolled courses |
| **Completed** | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_progress WHERE user_id = ? AND is_completed = 1` | Completed lessons |
| **Quizzes** | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM quiz_results WHERE user_id = ?` | Quizzes taken |
| **Notes** | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notes WHERE user_id = ?` | Total notes created |

---

### **3. Course Progress** 

**For Each Enrolled Course**:
```dart
// Get total lessons in course
final totalLessons = await _db.query(
  'lessons',
  where: 'course_id = ?',
  whereArgs: [courseId],
);

// Get completed lessons for this course
final completedLessons = await _db.query(
  'user_progress',
  where: 'user_id = ? AND course_id = ? AND is_completed = ?',
  whereArgs: [userId, courseId, 1],
);

// Calculate progress
final progress = completedLessons.length / totalLessons.length;
```

**Displays**:
-  Real course titles from database
-  Actual completion percentage
-  Progress bar with accurate values
-  Shows "No enrolled courses yet" if empty

---

### **4. Weekly Activity Chart** 

**Calculation**: Lessons completed per day for the last 7 days

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  final dayStart = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day - (6 - i));
  final dayEnd = dayStart.add(const Duration(days: 1));
  
  final dayProgress = await _db.query(
    'user_progress',
    where: 'user_id = ? AND is_completed = ? AND completed_at >= ? AND completed_at < ?',
    whereArgs: [userId, 1, dayStart.toIso8601String(), dayEnd.toIso8601String()],
  );
  
  _weeklyActivity[i] = dayProgress.length.toDouble();
}
```

**Shows**:
-  Monday through Sunday
-  Number of lessons completed each day
-  Dynamic bar heights based on actual activity
-  Last 7 days of data

---

##  UI Improvements

### **Loading State**
```dart
body: _isLoading
    ? const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
    : RefreshIndicator(...)
```

### **Pull-to-Refresh**
```dart
RefreshIndicator(
  onRefresh: _loadProgressData,
  child: SingleChildScrollView(...)
)
```

**Usage**: Swipe down to refresh all progress data!

### **Empty State**
```dart
..._courseProgress.isEmpty
    ? [
        Card(
          child: Center(
            child: Text('No enrolled courses yet'),
          ),
        ),
      ]
    : _courseProgress.map((course) => _buildCourseProgress(...))
```

##  Testing

### **Test Scenario 1: New User**
```
1. Login as a new user
2. Go to Progress screen
3.  Should show:
   - Overall Progress: 0%
   - All stats: 0
   - "No enrolled courses yet"
   - Empty weekly activity chart
```

### **Test Scenario 2: Active User**
```
1. Login as user with activity
2. Enroll in a course
3. Complete some lessons
4. Take a quiz
5. Create notes
6. Go to Progress screen
7.  Should show:
   - Real overall progress percentage
   - Actual counts for all stats
   - Course names with progress bars
   - Weekly activity bars
```

### **Test Scenario 3: Pull-to-Refresh**
```
1. On Progress screen
2. Swipe down from top
3.  Should show loading indicator
4.  Should reload all data
5.  Should update with latest progress
```

##  Data Flow

```
User Login
    ↓
Load Progress Screen
    ↓
Get userId from AuthProvider
    ↓
Query Database:
  - enrollments table → Course count
  - user_progress table → Completed lessons
  - quiz_results table → Quizzes taken
  - notes table → Notes count
  - courses table → Course details
  - lessons table → Total lessons per course
    ↓
Calculate:
  - Course progress percentages
  - Overall progress average
  - Weekly activity counts
    ↓
Update UI with Real Data
    ↓
Display to User
```

##  Progress Calculation Examples

### **Example 1: Single Course**
```
Course: "Flutter Basics"
Total Lessons: 10
Completed Lessons: 7
Progress: 7/10 = 70%
Overall Progress: 70%
```

### **Example 2: Multiple Courses**
```
Course 1: "Flutter Basics" → 7/10 = 70%
Course 2: "Dart Advanced" → 5/8 = 62.5%
Course 3: "State Management" → 3/6 = 50%

Overall Progress: (70 + 62.5 + 50) / 3 = 60.8%
```

### **Example 3: Weekly Activity**
```
Mon: 2 lessons completed
Tue: 5 lessons completed
Wed: 1 lesson completed
Thu: 3 lessons completed
Fri: 4 lessons completed
Sat: 0 lessons completed
Sun: 1 lesson completed

Chart shows bars with heights: [2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0, 1]
```
