The topic we choose (Education & Learning)Create a suitable mobile application under this topic.It should include 8 features. For example, an AI chat bot can be created. This mobile app also needs an AI chat bot feature.AI chat bot for these relevant sectors (education and learning). The chat bot must be created with an API and must not be accessible to an administrator. Also, we are creating this using flutter with dart. For this, sqlflite (Database) and VS CODE are the software used. For this, give me the plan that I need to create the Mobile Application. For example, how many pages does it consist of? How is the database created? How the administrator and user database, administrator and user UI Designs, and Backend Frontend are connected?. Create a complete CRUD mobile app.More details for mobile applicationSoftware Implementation:1.

Code walkthrough:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Represent the following requirement: (For mobile applications)1. The project should interact with a backend service or real-time database. Some of the choices for the backend could be, Google Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/)or even a custom backend to serve the data needed by the application.2. The application should support offline capabilities.you can decide whether the application is fully going to support offline data access or if its partial offline data access. We need (partial offline data access).3. The application needs to have a minimum of 5 independent screens (without user login and registration) providing functionalities of the application. (Functionalities should be cover by CRUD operations).4. Should have one or more custom control/component(s) implemented by the student himself (This does not mean that the entire application components need to be custom components Students can use a component library of choice. But there should be custom components developed by the student as well as part of the application).5. Should be implemented with state management approaches (RiverPod, Provider, etc.)Based on the above requirements, develop a Flutter application (with dart) using the specified user topic.Since the chosen field is “Education and Learning”, let's create a complete, detailed mobile app blueprint that fits the needs of your assignment and is realistic to build in Flutter (Dart) using SQLite (sqflite) and VS Code.Below, I’ll first suggest a suitable app idea, then explain features (8), architecture, pages/screens, database plan and how to build the app step-by-step.Recommended App Idea:– Smart Learning Assistant Platform What it is:--    Smart Learning Assistant Platform is a mobile app that helps students learn new topics through lessons, quizzes, notes, and an AI chatbot that assists with study questions.-    It combines offline learning, interactive quizzes and AI-powered Q&A, making it ideal for the Education & Learning domain.1. App Overview:--Platform: Flutter (Dart).-Backend: SQLite (local) with optional Firebase sync later.-State Management: Provider (or Riverpod).-IDE: Visual Studio Code.-Database: sqflite package.-Architecture: Feature-based folder structure (MVC / Clean Architecture).2. Main Features:- (8 Main Features)FeatureDescription1AI Chatbot AssistantHelps users ask study-related questions (can use dummy Q&A or API integration later).2Course List   Displays all available courses with titles, thumbnails, and progress.3Lessons / Topics ViewEach course has multiple lessons stored in SQLite, displayed with text, images, or videos.4Quiz Section  Each course has quizzes with MCQs (20 MCQs), stores score locally.5Notes Feature   Users can take(download), submit and delete personal notes (CRUD operation).6Progress TrackerTracks completed lessons, quiz scores, and shows performance summary.7Offline Mode  App works without internet using SQLite data. Sync to Firebase can be added later.8Notifications / RemindersLocal notifications to remind study times or incomplete lessons.  3. Application Architecture:--Use a feature-based folder structure for clarity:Project Folder Structure:- The project follows a feature-based folder structure for better maintainability, scalability, and readability. This structure allows independent development of each feature such as authentication, courses, quizzes, notes, etc., without interference between modules.Purpose of This Structure:• Ensures modularity – each feature works independently.• Promotes clean architecture – separates UI, data, and logic layers.• Makes the app scalable – easy to add new modules.• Improves code readability and reusability.For example:-lib/ ??? main.dart ??? core/ ?    ??? models/ ?    ??? database/ ?    ??? constants/ ??? features/ ?    ??? auth/ ?    ??? courses/ ?    ??? lessons/ ?    ??? quiz/ ?    ??? notes/ ?    ??? chatbot/ ?    ??? profile/ ??? providers/ ??? widgets/-Each feature has its own screens, models, and controllers.4. Screen / Page Plan (Minimum 5 independent screens)Facilities provided to the user:- (CRUD / Functionality)(Users) Page(Users) Description(Users) CRUD / Functionality1?? Home PageDashboard with navigation to all sections (Courses, Notes, Chatbot, etc.)Users can Read/View 2?? Course List PageList of courses from SQLflite.Users can Read, View.Users can join (Add course) the course. (Full CRUD)3?? Lesson PageDisplays lessons (Doc, PDF, Picture) of a course.Read, View, Download (Full CRUD)4?? Quiz PageDisplays multiple-choice questions, shows result.Users can Read, View Score and questions, User can mark answers to questions. (Full CRUD)5?? Notes PageAllows users to Submit/download/delete personal notes.Full CRUD6?? Chatbot PageQ&A AI chat bot (API simulated).Users can read/view answers, Users can ask questions and more information.7?? Progress Tracker PageShows learning progress, badges, achievements.Users can Read/View8?? Settings/Profile PageEdit profile, view and read notifications.Full CRUDYou can merge or simplify screens to meet the “minimum 5 independent screens” requirement.5. Database:- (SQLflite)Example:- Tables6. Development Plan:--CRUD Operations-UI/UX Design-AI Chatbot-Offline/Online Support-Local Notifications-State Management-Many moreAdministrator module to this Mobile Application:- “Smart Learning Assistant Platform”Adding an Administrator module to this “Smart Learning Assistant Platform” app is a great idea. It makes this project look more professional, complete, and realistic, since it now has a user (student) side and an admin side for managing all data (courses, lessons, quizzes, etc.).Let’s design the Administrator’s system in detail - including features, database access, screens, architecture and full creation plan - so it integrates cleanly into your Flutter + SQLflite setup.Administrator Module:- OverviewThe admin is responsible for managing all educational content and monitoring app usage.He has special access to the database and can add, edit, or remove data such as:-Courses-Lessons-Quizzes-Users-NotificationsThis can be implemented inside the same Flutter app, but with a separate login for the admin - or as a separate admin panel if you prefer.1. Admin System Type:-Integrated Admin Login (same app):-The app has two roles: Admin and Student.-Admin logs in using a special username/password.-The app shows different UI and permissions for Admin.Best for this coursework - simpler to implement with SQLflite and fits within one Flutter app.2. Admin Features:- (Administrative Main Functions)FeatureDescriptionCRUD Functionality1Admin DashboardOverview of total courses, lessons, quizzes, and users.Read/View 2Course ManagementAdd, edit, delete courses.Full CRUD3Lesson ManagementManage lessons (Add, edit, delete) inside each course.Full CRUD4Quiz ManagementCreate or modify (edit, delete) quiz questions. Full CRUD5User Management (optional)View list of users (students).Read/View/Delete6Notifications ManagementSend study reminders or news/events updates to all users.Create/Delete7Reports / AnalyticsView student progress, quiz scores, and app statistics.Read/View3. Admin Pages / Screens:-PageDescriptionNavigation1?? Login PageCommon for both Admin & StudentFirst screen2?? Admin Dashboard PageShows statistics (no. of courses, lessons, etc.)Home for Admin3?? Manage Courses PageAdd/Edit/Delete coursesAccess from dashboard4?? Manage Lessons PageFilter by course, edit, delete, add lessonsAccess from courses5?? Manage Quizzes PageCRUD for quiz questions (Add/Edit/Delete)Access from dashboard6?? Notifications PageManage study reminders.Send study reminders or news/events updates to all users.Access from dashboard7?? User List PageView all registered usersAccess from dashboard8?? Reports PageView quiz results and users progressAccess from dashboardMinimum 5 screens still satisfied (Dashboard, Courses, Lessons, Quiz, Reports).4. Database Integration for Admin:-Since both admin and students use the same SQLflite database, the difference is in access control (role-based access).5. How the Admin Connects to the Database:-Since SQLflite is local:-Both admin and student share the same database file stored on the device.Optional: Firebase Integration        If you add Firebase later, you can:-Upload all SQLflite tables to Firebase Firestore.-Sync data changes (courses, lessons, etc.) automatically.-Allow remote admin access from another device.6. UI/UX Design for Admin SectionUse a different color theme for admin (e.g. dark blue/orange) to separate roles visually.Example UI Widgets:* Cards showing total items (Courses: 5, Lessons: 20, etc.)* FloatingActionButton (FAB) for “Add Course” or “Add Lesson”* DataTable or ListView for viewing items* Dialog Box or Bottom Sheet for editing/deleting items7. Final Admin Module Summary:-ElementDetailsRoleMaintains all content and usersAccessAdmin login (username/password in SQLflite)Database ConnectionLocal SQLflite database via DatabaseHelperFeaturesCRUD Functionality for Courses, Lessons, Quizzes, Users, Notifications and otherUI PagesDashboard, Course Management, Lesson Management, Quiz Management, User Management, Notification Management, Reports Management.SecurityRole-based routingTools UsedFlutter (Dart), sqlflite, Provider, VS CodeOffline SupportFull (SQLflite)Optional SyncFirebase Firestore for remote admin use
