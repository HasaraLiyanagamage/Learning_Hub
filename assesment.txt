This course work covers 70% of total marks.1. Case Study:Students are required to formulate a mobile project idea which will fall under one of the following areas.0 - Health & Fitness1 - Travel/Tourism2 - Food and Drink 3 - Education & Learning4 - Entertainment & LifestyleTo figure out your team project topic students’ needs to take their index number and add all the numbers of the index number (calculate digit sum) and find the modulus by 5, the resulting number would denote your respective project area.Example: If index = 2021456 ? digit sum = 20 ? 20 % 5 = 0 ? Health & FitnessOnce the project area is identified, students are required to come up with a mobile project idea in this area. When formulating the project idea keep in mind the time duration and focus on identifying features that. Represent the following requirement:1. The project should interact with a backend service or real-time database. Some of the choices for the backend could be, Google Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/)or even a custom backend to serve the data needed by the application.2. The application should support offline capabilities.Students can decide whether the application is fully going to support offline data access or if its partial offline data access.3. The application needs to have a minimum of 5 independent screens (without user login and registration) providing functionalities of the application. (Functionalities should be cover by CRUD operations).4. Should have one or more custom control/component(s) implemented by the student himself (This does not mean that the entire application components need to be custom components Students can use a component library of choice. But there should be custom components developed by the student as well as part of the application).5. Should be implemented with state management approaches (RiverPod, Provider, etc.)Based on the above requirements, develop a Flutter application using the specified user topic.Part A – Software Implementation (80%)1.

Technical Documentation (20 marks) Prepare a PDF report with:Table of Contents1. Overview of the Project and Available Features- Brief description of the weather app and chosen features.2. Project Architecture/Design 2.1 Architecture/Design Pattern used (e.g., Clean, MVVM, BLoC). 2.2 Project Structure (organized by feature or layer).3.  API/Database Integration2.4 API endpoints2.5 API data parsing and models.2.6 API implementation in code (with CRUD demonstration if relevant).2.7 Database implementation 2.8 offline features implementation2.9 Data synchronisation 2.7 Other implemented features (favorites, notifications, etc.).4. State Management- Code examples.5. Third-party Libraries- Libraries used (e.g., Dio, Lottie, Hive, Syncfusion).- Purpose and usage in the project.6. UI/UX Design- Final design showcase.- Wireframes/prototypes.- Application of UI/UX best practices.7. Testing- Test Cases8. Issues/Errors and Failures in Development- Bugs encountered and fixes applied.9. References(Harvard format).? Deliverables (10 marks)- Final Presentaion- Release APK file.- Source code on GitHub with version control.2. SubmissionThe final submission should include the demonstration video, technical documentation, source code and the app’s final release file (APK). ? Final release file (APK) summation:Students must build a final release APK. This final release APK should be uploaded to the student's Google Drive and shared with the setting 'Anyone with the link.' The final release APK link must be included in the appendix of the technical report.? Source code summation:Students must create a public repository on their own GitHub (or Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.). Push the source code to this repository. Include the repository link in the appendix of the technical report.? Final Presentation summation: Students must submit a presentation with the final submission, covering the following topics. This final presentation should be uploaded to the student's Google Drive with the setting 'Anyone with the link.' The final presentation link must be included in the appendix of the technical report.Presentation should be consisting of the following major topics. - Outline of the idea.- Main functionalities.- Implementations  - firebase/REST API  - 3rd party libraries  - state management  - offline features- Demo of the mobile application. - Code walkthrough*Groups must prepare a presentation covering the above topics within 10 minutes.3.

Work containing vague descriptions or unsupported assertions will be penalised.Feedback:You can invite the module-staff to review your progress and provide formative-feedback. Academic Integrity:Academic integrity means demonstrating honest, moral behaviours when producing academic work. This involves acknowledging the work of others, giving appropriate credit to others where their ideas are presented as part of your work and the importance of producing work in your own voice. Contributions by artificial intelligence (AI) tools must be properly acknowledged. As part of a learning community students share ideas and develop new ones - you need to be able to interpret and present other people's ideas and combine these with your own when producing work.Plagiarism (including copying, self-plagiarism and collusion)The act of presenting the work of another person (or people) and/or content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) tools as your own without proper acknowledgement. This includes copying the work of another student or other students.The University expects students to take responsibility for the security of their work (i.e. with written work, to ensure that other students do not get access to electronic or hard copy of the work). Failure to keep work secure may allow others to cheat, and could result in an allegation of academic misconduct for students whose work have been copied, particularly if the origin of the work is in doubt.Self-plagiarismThe act of presenting part or all of your work that has been previously submitted to meet the requirements of a different assessment, except where the nature of the assessment makes this permissible.CollusionThe act, by two or more students, of presenting a piece of work jointly without acknowledging the collaboration. This could include permitting or assisting another to present work that has been copied or paraphrased from your own work.The University also defines collusion as the act of one student presenting a piece of work as their own independent work when the work was undertaken by a group. With group work, where individual members submit parts of the total assignment, each member of a group must take responsibility for checking the legitimacy of the work submitted in his/her name. If even part of the work is found to contain academic misconduct, penalties will normally be imposed on all group members equally.Purchasing or CommissioningThe act of attempting to purchase or purchasing work for an assessment including, for example from the internet, or attempting to commission, or commissioning someone else to complete an assessment on your behalf.The procedures for investigating suspected cases of academic misconduct are set out in Academic Regulations 6 Academic Integrity - Taught Courses 2023/24You must meet all deadlines set. Failure to do so will result in a penalty. Work submitted late but within a week of the deadline will be capped at 40% and receive a grade of LP (Late Pass) unless it is not of a passing standard in which case it will receive a grade of LF (Late Fail). Work submitted beyond a week of the deadline without approval will get 0% with a grade of F0. If, however, you have a serious problem, which prevents you from, meeting the deadline you may be able to negotiate an extension in advance. In the first instance you should contact the module team for advice. However any extension will need to be formally agreed by the Faculty via the Mitigating Circumstances process, your work will then be marked without penalty.                                                                                                          2
