Smart Learning Assistant Platform
Mobile Application Development Ð Complete Specification (Coursework Ready)

1. Project Overview
Domain: Education & Learning
Platform: Cross-platform Mobile Application
Framework: Flutter (Dart)
State Management: Provider (or Riverpod)
Local Database: SQLite (sqflite)
Backend Service: Firebase Firestore / REST API
Architecture: Clean Architecture with Feature-Based Folder Structure
The Smart Learning Assistant Platform is a mobile application designed to help students learn effectively through courses, lessons, quizzes, notes, progress tracking, notifications, and an AI-powered chatbot. The application supports partial offline access, full CRUD operations, backend interaction, and data synchronization, fulfilling all requirements of the Mobile Application Development Coursework.

2. Objectives of the Application
* Provide an interactive learning platform for students
* Support offline learning using SQLite
* Synchronize data with a backend service when online
* Implement full CRUD functionality
* Demonstrate proper architecture, state management, and UI/UX best practices
* Include both User (Student) and Administrator modules

5. Project Folder Structure (Feature-Based)
lib/
 ??? main.dart
 ??? core/
 ?    ??? models/
 ?    ??? services/ (api_service, sync_service)
 ?    ??? database/ (db_helper)
 ?    ??? constants/
 ??? features/
 ?    ??? auth/
 ?    ??? courses/
 ?    ??? lessons/
 ?    ??? quiz/
 ?    ??? notes/
 ?    ??? chatbot/
 ?    ??? progress/
 ?    ??? admin/
 ??? providers/
 ??? widgets/ (custom components)

6. Screens / Pages (Minimum 5 Independent Screens)
User (Student) Screens
1. Home Dashboard
2. Course List Page
3. Lesson Page
4. Quiz Page
5. Notes Page
6. Chatbot Page
7. Progress Tracker
8. Settings/Profile Page
(All major screens support CRUD where applicable.)

7. Database Design (SQLite)
Core Tables
* users
* courses
* lessons
* quizzes
* quiz_results
* notes
* progress
* notifications
Synchronization Fields
* sync_status (0 = pending, 1 = synced)
* last_updated (DateTime)

8. Backend & API Integration (Mandatory)
Backend Choice
* Firebase Firestore (recommended)
API Responsibilities
* Store master data (courses, lessons, quizzes)
* Store user progress and quiz results
* Enable future multi-device support
Example API Endpoints
* GET /courses
* POST /courses
* PUT /courses/{id}
* DELETE /courses/{id}
* GET /lessons?courseId=
* POST /quiz-results

9. Offline & Online Data Synchronization
Strategy (Partial Offline Support)
* Online: Fetch data from Firebase ? Cache in SQLite
* Offline: Read/write from SQLite only
* Reconnect: Sync pending records using timestamps
This satisfies the offline + online data flow requirement.

10. State Management
* Provider / Riverpod used across all features
* Separate providers for:
o Courses
o Lessons
o Quizzes
o Notes
o Chatbot

11. Custom Components (Mandatory)
Examples: - Custom Course Card Widget - Custom Quiz Option Button - Custom Progress Indicator - Custom Chat Bubble Widget
