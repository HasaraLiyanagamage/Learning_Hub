# 🚨 CRITICAL: App Reinstall Required

## Current Status

You have completed lessons and quizzes, but the progress is not updating because:

1. ✅ **Code fixes are applied** (lesson completion, progress calculation)
2. ❌ **Database schema is outdated** (missing required columns)
3. ❌ **Old data in database** (doesn't have the new structure)

---

## Why Progress Shows 0%

### **The Problem**:

Your current app is running with **database version 4**, but the fixes require **database version 6**.

**Missing columns in your current database**:
- `user_progress` table missing: `is_completed`, `completed_at`
- `enrollments` table missing: `progress`, `status`

**What happens**:
1. You complete a lesson ✅
2. App tries to insert into `user_progress` with `is_completed` column ❌
3. Database error: "no such column: is_completed" ❌
4. Progress not saved ❌
5. UI shows 0% ❌

---

## 🔧 All Fixes Applied

### **Fix 1: Lesson Completion Tracking**
**File**: `lib/features/lessons/screens/lesson_detail_screen.dart`
- ✅ Now creates/updates `user_progress` records
- ✅ Tracks `is_completed` flag
- ✅ Records `completed_at` timestamp
- ✅ Links to user, course, and lesson

### **Fix 2: Progress Calculation**
**File**: `lib/features/courses/screens/my_courses_screen.dart`
- ✅ Calculates progress from actual lesson completion
- ✅ Updates `enrollments.progress` field
- ✅ Shows real-time percentage

### **Fix 3: Course Detail Refresh**
**File**: `lib/features/courses/screens/course_detail_screen.dart`
- ✅ Refreshes data after returning from lesson
- ✅ Updates lesson completion status

### **Fix 4: Dashboard Error Handling**
**File**: `lib/features/courses/screens/user_dashboard_screen.dart`
- ✅ Handles database errors gracefully
- ✅ Shows error messages instead of infinite loading

### **Fix 5: Database Schema**
**Files**: `lib/services/database_helper.dart`, `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`
- ✅ Added `is_completed` and `completed_at` to `user_progress`
- ✅ Added `progress` and `status` to `enrollments`
- ✅ Updated database version to 6

## 🚨 REQUIRED: Reinstall the App

### **Why Reinstall?**

Flutter apps don't automatically update the database schema on hot restart. You need to:
1. Uninstall the app (deletes old database)
2. Reinstall (creates new database with version 6)

### **Option 1: Uninstall & Reinstall (Recommended)**

```bash
# 1. Stop the app
# Press Ctrl+C in terminal or stop button in IDE

# 2. Uninstall from device/emulator
# Go to device: Settings → Apps → Smart Learning Hub → Uninstall
# OR for emulator: Long press app icon → Uninstall

# 3. Clean Flutter build
flutter clean

# 4. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 5. Reinstall and run
flutter run
```

### **Option 2: Clear App Data (Alternative)**

If you can't uninstall:
```
1. Go to device Settings
2. Apps → Smart Learning Hub
3. Storage → Clear Data
4. Restart the app
```

## ✅ After Reinstalling

### **What Will Happen**:

1. **Fresh Database**:
   - Database version 6 created
   - All tables have correct columns
   - No old data (clean slate)

2. **You'll Need To**:
   - Re-login (john@example.com / user123)
   - Re-enroll in courses
   - Complete lessons again

3. **Progress Will Work**:
   - ✅ Dashboard updates in real-time
   - ✅ My Courses shows correct progress
   - ✅ Progress page displays stats
   - ✅ Lesson completion tracked
   - ✅ Quiz completion tracked

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **Check 1: Database Version**
After reinstall, the app should be using database version 6.

### **Check 2: No Errors**
- No red error messages
- No infinite loading spinners
- No "column not found" errors

### **Check 3: Real-Time Updates**
- Complete a lesson → Progress updates immediately
- Navigate between screens → Data stays consistent
- Close and reopen app → Progress persists

### **Check 4: Data Synchronization**
- Dashboard, My Courses, and Progress page all show same data
- Completing a lesson updates all three screens
- No discrepancies between screens

## 🐛 If Still Not Working After Reinstall

### **Scenario 1: Still Shows 0%**

**Check**:
1. Did you actually uninstall the app?
2. Did you run `flutter clean`?
3. Did you re-enroll in courses after reinstall?

**Solution**:
```bash
# Force complete rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run --no-fast-start
```

### **Scenario 2: Errors Appear**

**Check the error message**:
- "no such column" → Database not recreated, uninstall again
- "null check operator" → Login issue, re-login
- "unique constraint" → Already enrolled, try different course

**Solution**:
- Read the error message carefully
- Share the error with me for specific fix

### **Scenario 3: Progress Updates But Doesn't Persist**

**Check**:
- Close app completely
- Reopen app
- Check if progress is still there

**If progress disappears**:
- Database write issue
- Check device storage permissions

## 📝 Database Schema (Version 6)

### **user_progress Table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_progress (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

  is_completed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,        -- ✅ NEW
  completed_at TEXT,                      -- ✅ NEW
  last_accessed TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (lesson_id) REFERENCES lessons (id)
)
```

### **enrollments Table**:
