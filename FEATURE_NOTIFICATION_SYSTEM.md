##  How to Add More Notifications

### **Step 1: Add Method to NotificationService**
```dart
Future<void> createYourNotification({
  required int userId,
  required String someData,
}) async {
  final now = DateTime.now().toIso8601String();
  
  final notification = NotificationModel(
    userId: userId,
    title: 'Your Title',
    message: 'Your message with $someData',
    type: 'your_type',
    createdAt: now,
    updatedAt: now,
  );

  final id = await saveNotification(notification);

  await showNotification(
    id: id,
    title: notification.title,
    body: notification.message,
  );
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Call from Appropriate Screen**
```dart
// Import notification service
final NotificationService _notificationService = NotificationService();

// Call when event happens
await _notificationService.createYourNotification(
  userId: userId,
  someData: 'data',
);
```

---

### **Step 3: Add Icon/Color (Optional)**
In `notifications_screen.dart`:
```dart
IconData _getNotificationIcon(String type) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'your_type':
      return Icons.your_icon;
    // ... other cases
  }
}

Color _getNotificationColor(String type) {
  switch (type) {
    case 'your_type':
      return Colors.yourColor;
    // ... other cases
  }
}
```
